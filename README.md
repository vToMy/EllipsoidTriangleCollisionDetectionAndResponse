# Ellipsoid-Triangle Collision Detection & Response

Source code for an old project of mine.

YouTube demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH9QmZl2MQw

An XNA implementation of ellipsoid-triangle collision detection and response.

Based on the "Improved Collision Detection and Response" by Kasper Fauerby (http://peroxide.dk/tuts_c.shtml)

Also note the "gravity" isn't really gravity, just a pointed down velocity (for simplicity).
